the ability to lock a seat on a first come first serve basis. 
While in booking mode with the seating plan, all subsequent bookings that is taking place should 
be real-time displaying all users’ activities within the selected train sitting seating plan.

booking on seat A3, User 1’s seating plan will show A3 as being locked and User 1 or any 
subsequent users will not be able to book this seat.
